        <h2><strong>What is an Array?</strong></h2>
        <p>An array holds a collection of data in a single variable. The data items in an array are
            referred to as elements. Each element has an index which starts at zero. Array indexes are used to access
            and
            modify elements as well as add new elements</p>

        <h2><strong>Importance of Arrays</strong></h2>
        <p>To demonstrate how arrays can be useful, consider assigning the five oceans of the world to their own
            variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            // Assign the five oceans to five variables: <br>
            const ocean1 = "Pacific"; <br>
            const ocean2 = "Atlantic"; <br>
            const ocean3 = "Indian"; <br>
            const ocean4 = "Arctic"; <br>
            const ocean5 = "Antarctic"; <br>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>This method is very verbose, and can quickly become difficult to maintain and keep track of.</p>

        <p>Using arrays, we can simplify our data.</p>

        <p>Assign the five oceans:</p>
        <p>let oceans = [ <br>
            "Pacific", <br>
            "Atlantic", <br>
            "Indian", <br>
            "Arctic", <br>
            "Antarctic", <br>
            ];</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p> Instead of creating five separate variables, we now have one variable that contains all five elements. We
            used
            square brackets — [] — to create an array.</p>

        <p> To access a specific item, append its index to the variable.</p>

        <p> // Print out the first item of the oceans array: <br>
            oceans[0]; <br>
            Output: Pacific
        </p>
